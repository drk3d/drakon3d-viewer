## 🌟 Key Features (주요 기능)

* **High-Fidelity CAD Formats:** Support for `.3dm` (Rhino 3D versions 5–8), `.glb`, `.stl`, `.3mf`, and `.stp`/`.step`/`.igs` file drops.
* **Premium Shading Modes:** Interactive shaded, wireframe, technical sketch, rendered, and beautiful **Arctic (Ambient Occlusion style)** modes.
* **Smart Session Management:** Save your entire viewing session—including camera perspectives, custom colors, layer visibilities, measurements, and lights—into a single `.rhv` package.
* **Export Package (HTML):** Export the viewer **and** the current model as one self-contained, offline `.html` file. Double-click to open in any browser—no server, plugin, or internet required. Ideal for sending models to clients for review.
* **Named Views:** Save custom camera viewpoints and animate transitions seamlessly.
* **Analysis Tools:** In-app distance/angle measurement utilities with smart vertex snapping, and real-time interactive clipping plane sections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `www/viewer-shell.html` is a **build artifact** consumed at runtime by the
> Export Package feature. Re-run `npm run build:shell` whenever the viewer
> source (`www/*.js`, `style.css`) changes, so exported packages embed the
> latest viewer.

> [!NOTE]
> Local development and build configurations for mobile platforms (Android/iOS) are ignored via `.gitignore` to maintain a lightweight, clean web-viewer-only repository layout for open-source distribution.

## 🚀 Running Locally (로컬 실행 방법)

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Launch Local Dev Server
To start the local development server (served via `http-server` on port 8080):
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to interact with the viewer.

### 3. (Optional) Build the Offline Export Shell
The **Export Package (HTML)** feature relies on a prebuilt, fully-inlined viewer
shell. Regenerate it after changing any viewer source:
```bash
npm run build:shell   # bundles the viewer → www/viewer-shell.html
```
